**Question:**
Implement a function `reverse_linked_list` in Python that takes the head of a singly linked list as input and returns the reversed list without modifying the original list. You should use an iterative approach.

Example:
If your input is `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, your function should return `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

**Explanation:**
This question tests your understanding of reversing a singly linked list using an iterative approach. It's important to understand the relationship between nodes in a linked list and how you can traverse it in reverse order without recursion.

**Skill Level:** Beginner

**Justification:**
- This question is appropriate for beginners because it focuses on a single, well-defined task that can be solved with basic knowledge of linked lists and pointers.
- It does not require advanced data structure manipulation or algorithmic complexity considerations.
- The iterative approach makes the solution more accessible to beginners compared to recursive solutions.
